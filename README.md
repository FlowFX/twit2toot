# twit2toot
A Twitter to Mastodon bridge aiming to create "natural" sounding and looking Toots from Tweets. The main goal of this project is for [@Cheatha](https://twitter.com/cheatha) to push more and more of his content into the Fediverse.

## Proposed features
- Clean URLs, removing Twitter's `t.co` crap.
- Rewritten @mentions from the Twitter handle to e.g. `@Cheatha@twitter.com`.
- Native media files, requiring for images to be re-uploaded to the Mastodon instance.
